    <p>This document describes and prioritises gaps for the support of the Devanagari script on the Web and in eBooks. In particular, it is concerned with text layout. It checks that needed features are supported in W3C specifications, in particular HTML and CSS and those relating to digital publications. It also checks whether the features have been implemented in browsers and ereaders. This document complements the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/devanagari/"> Devanagari Layout Requirements</a>, which describes the requirements for areas where gaps appear. It is linked to from the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html">language matrix</a> that tracks Web support for many languages.</p>
<p>The editor's draft of this document is being developed by the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/iip/">India International Program Layout Task Force</a>, part of the W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/ig/">Internationalization Interest Group</a>. It is published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization Working Group</a>. The end target for this document is a Working Group Note.</p>

  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the  needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
    
    <p>This page documents difficulties people encounter when trying to use the Hindi and Marathi languages in the Devanagari script on the Web. </p>
<p>Having identified an issue, it investigates the current status with regards to web specifications and implementations by user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.), and attempts to prioritise the severity of the issue for web users.</p>

    <p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" style="font-size: 140%;">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span></p>

    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic should be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/xxxxlreq/">Xxxx Layout Requirements</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritisation is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

	<h4>Indian Scripts and Baselines</h4>
	<p>By and large, Indian scripts in browsers are rendered with default fonts provided by back-end Operating Systems. If there are major differences in physical size for a particular font size, which most of the times are, it shows the mixed-script text in an un-organized way. This obviously affects all the base-line attributes.</p>

<p id="prompt-segmentation" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


    <section id="grapheme_clusters">
    <h4>Grapheme clusters</h4>
        <p>The Unicode concept of 'grapheme cluster' currently fails to represent syllabic conjuncts (plus vowels, etc) in scripts like Devanagari. This means that various editing operations, line breaking algorithms, vertical text, etc. are likely to break text at the wrong point.</p>
    <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/ilreq/#h_indic_orthographic_syllable_boundaries">Indic Layout Requirements</a> provides a grammar for indian orthographic syllable boundaries which works for Devanagari, and CSS uses the concept of <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit">'typographic character unit'</a>, rather than grapheme cluster, in its specs with the explanation that these cases are beyond the scope of the grapheme cluster concept and that implementations should provide appropriate support. In addition, a modification to the concept of grapheme cluster is <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/proposed.html#Rule_Constraints">currently in development</a> at the Unicode Consortium, which is likely to resolve the problem for a script like Devanagari.</p>
    <p>See requirements at: <a href="https://w3c.github.io/ilreq/#h_indic_orthographic_syllable_boundaries">Indic Layout Requirements</a></p>
    <p>Relevant tests:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/International/tests/repo/results/first-letter#devanagari">Selectors 3, first-letter</a></li>
    <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="danda">
    <h4>Danda selection</h4>
    <p>When the  Devanagari phrase separator ।  U+0964 DEVANAGARI DANDA (called purna viram in Hindi) or ॥  U+0965 DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA (deergh viram in Hindi) are used, some browsers select them with the preceding word on double-click, while in other browsers they are selected separately. </p>
    <p>The properties of purna viram and deergh viram should be the same as the properties of FullStop or other punctuation marks, and a new line should not begin with purna viram and deergh viram.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="spanned_conjuncts">
    <h4>Spans around partial orthographic syllables</h4>
    <p>If you put a span around the first two characters of the 3-character syllable स्तिठड (eg. in order to color or otherwise style it), the i vowel-sign no longer appears at the start of the word, but looks like it modifies the next character (ठ).
	<br/>
	Apparently this requirement is a bit difficult to cater to as it requires the knowledge to be transferred by the font to the rendering engine about which part of the glyph is attributed to which code-point in storage. However, if it can be achieved, nothing like it.

	<h4 class="reviewme">Underline and Overline behavior</h4>
    <p>Indian language text has some signs called as Matras which sometimes join above the shirorekha or below the normal baseline.
	<br/><br/>
	Applications should ensure that the underline and overline when getting rendered, should adaquetly be taken into consideration. Chrome browser seemed to be perfectly rendering the underline and overline feature by breaking the same where a matra occurs. Internet Explorer also handles it a bit differently by appropriately lowering or heightening the respective lines.

<section id="quotations" class="advanced">
<h3 class="reviewme">Quotations</h3>
<p id="prompt-quotations" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


<section id="q_defaults">
<h4><a href="#q_defaults">Default quotation marks for q element</a></h4>
<p>If the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag sets the language of a page, the HTML specification says that  the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element should by default produce quotation marks according to the information in CLDR for that language.</p>
<p>For Hindi and Marathi, CLDR says that the default quote marks should be, reading right to left, “...”, and embedded quote marks ‘...’. <strong>Edge</strong> fails to produce any quotation marks, although it does so for other languages. (Firefox, Chrome &amp; Safari are ok.) See a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#language">test and results</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="q_section">
<h4><a href="#q_section">Default quotation marks in a new language section</a></h4>
<p>In addition, the default quotation marks for the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element  are not set to the appropriate characters by the browser  when the element appears inside a Hindi/Marathi section of a page that has a different overall language. This is currently per the HTML specification (both W3C and WhatWG).  There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636#issuecomment-384340053">an issue</a> raised against the WhatWG version for this to be changed.</p>
</section>

<section id="q_multilingual">
<h4><a href="#q_multilingual">Embedded quotations in a different language</a></h4>
<p>Hindi/Marathi quotes embedded in text in another language can also be problematic if the outer language uses different quotation marks. This is due to the browsers choosing default quotation marks based on the language of the <em>quotation</em>, rather than that of the surrounding text. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#ml_nesting">a test</a>. This behaviour is specified in the WhatWG version of the HTML spec, but no longer in the W3C version. There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636#issuecomment-384340053">an issue</a> raised against the WhatWG version for this to be changed.</p>
</section>

<p>Marking all the above as advanced, because use of the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element is optional (quote characters can be used instead), and it can be styled using CSS for the general case.</p>

    <h4>Devanagari Numerals</h4>
    <p>Generally Latin Numerals are acceptable in Devanagari text. Most of the user community identifies with them. However, there could be cases where certain web-pages would prefer to have numerals in Devanagari to cater to mono-lingual (mono-script rather) readers. This is particularly required for input types number and date. It would be useful if the input type values are augmented with the script mnemonics e.g. number_deva or date_deva instead of changing it for entire page through some locale setting. There could be cases where a user may require both kinds of numbering in the same web-page.</p>

	<h4>Inter Character/Akshara spacing for Indian languages</h4>
    <p>For various reasons wherever a word needs to be broken in constituent characters in case of Latin script, Indian language words can and should be broken based on Akshara as given <a href="https://w3c.github.io/ilreq/#h_letter_spacing">here</a>
    <br/>
	As the W3C specification points to Unicode Text Segmentation (TR 29), it is observed that some of the browsers support it (e.g. Chrome and Firefox) whereas Microsoft Edge and Interner Explorer seems to break the words in individual characters.
	<br/>
	It has been marked as basic as the Unicode Text Segmentation rules themselves need to be matured enough to cater to nuances of many languages that get written using Devanagari script. Some of the languages like Santali, require some special Nukta rules. 
	<br/>
	Also, in cases where there is wrong Akshara formation e.g. Consonant+Matra+Matra, the breaking seems to stack ill formed akshara into one set instead of clearly breaking it separate. This breaking behaviour needs to improve.

Only the first is defined also in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-counter-styles-3/#simple-numeric">CSS Counter Styles specification</a>, the other relies on the user-defined mechanism specified in that spec in order to be applied.</p>
    <p>The <code class="kw" translate="no">devanagari</code> counter style is not supported by <span class="fail">Edge</span> (or <span class="fail">IE</span>), but is supported by <span class="pass">Firefox</span>, <span class="pass">Chrome, and Safari</span>.

<section id="initials" class="basic">
<h3>Styling initials</h3>
<p id="prompt-initials" class="status_prompt promptStub"></p>


<section id="initial_segmentation">
<h4>Segmentation problematic</h4>
    <p>Because of the problems associated with grapheme cluster boundaries (see above), first-letter selection in CSS doesn't work well for conjuncts. For example, Chrome, IE and Edge fail to style the whole conjunct in क्शण when using ::first-letter in a selector, and styles only the क्. This is problematic for many words in a script such as Devanagari, and forces the content author to use explicit spans rather than the proper mechanism for selecting initial letter.</p>
    <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/ilreq/#h_indic_orthographic_syllable_boundaries">Indian Layout Requirements</a> provides a grammar for indian orthographic syllable boundaries which works for Devanagari, and CSS uses the concept of <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit">'typographic character unit'</a>, rather than grapheme cluster, in its specs with the explanation that these cases are beyond the scope of the grapheme cluster concept and that implementations should provide appropriate support.
