    <p>This document describes requirements for the layout and presentation of text in languages that use the Tamil script when they are used by Web standards and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, Mobile Web, Digital Publications, and Unicode.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="sotd">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">This early draft has not yet been through any review process. Please do not rely on the contents.</p>
    <p>This document describes the basic requirements for Tamil script layout and text support on the Web and in eBooks. These requirements provide information for Web technologies such as CSS, HTML and digital publications about how to support users of Tamil scripts. Currently the document focuses on Tamil as used for the Tamil language. The information here is developed in conjunction with a <a href="../gap-analysis/taml-gap.html">document that summarises gaps</a> in support on the Web for Tamil.</p>
<p>The editor's draft of this document is being developed by the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/iip/">India International Program Task Force</a>, part of the W3C <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/ig/">Internationalization Interest Group</a>. It will be published by the <a href="http://www.w3.org/International/core/">Internationalization Working Group</a>. The end target for this document is a Working Group Note.</p>

    <section id="h_about_this_document">
      <h3>About this document</h3>

      <p>This document provides information about the Tamil script is used for the Tamil language. </p>
<p>This document should contain no reference to a particular technology. For example, it should not say &quot;CSS does/doesn't do such and such&quot;, and it should not describe how a technology, such as CSS, should implement the requirements. It is technology agnostic, so that it will be evergreen, and it simply describes how the script works. The gap analysis document is the appropriate place for all kinds of technology-specific information.</p>
    </section>

  <section id="h_gap_analysis">
  <h3>Gap analysis</h3>

    <p>This document is pointed to by a separate document, <a href="../gap-analysis/taml-gap.html">Tamil Gap Analysis</a>, which describes gaps in support for Tamil on the Web, and prioritises and describes the impact of those gaps on the user.</p>
<p>Wherever an unsupported feature is indentified through the gap analysis process, the requirements for that feature need to be documented. This  document is where those requirements are described.</p>
</section>


  <section id="h_info_requests">
  <h3>Other related resources</h3>

    <p>The document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/">International text layout and typography index</a> (known informally as the text layout index) points to this document and others, and provides a central location for developers and implementers to find information related to various scripts.</p>
<p>The W3C also maintains a tracking system that  has links to github issues in W3C repositories. There are separate links for (a) requests from developers to the user community for information about how scripts/languages work, (b) issues raised against a spec, and (c) browser bugs.  For example, you can find out <a href="http://w3c.github.io/i18n-activity/textlayout/?filter=type-info-request">what information developers are currently seeking</a>, and the resulting list can also be filtered by script.</p>
<p>This document also uses <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/ilreq/">Indic Layout Requirements</a> as a source for certain information.</p>

<section id="h_script_overview">
<h2>Tamil Script Overview</h2>
    <p>Tamil is an abugida.  Consonant letters have an inherent vowel sound. Combining vowel-signs are attached to the consonant to indicate that a different vowel follows the consonant.</p>
<p>The orthographic syllable is the unit for various aspects of the behaviour of the script. The alphabet is split into vowels and consonants. </p>
<p>Text runs horizontally, left to right, and lines typically break at the spaces between words. </p>
<p>The script has no upper-/lowercase distinction.</p>
<p><a href="https://r12a.github.io/scripts/tamil/">Tamil script summary</a> can be read for a high level overview of characters used for the script, and some basic features. Text from that the latter part of that page was used for the initial version of this document.</p>

<h2 id="h_text_direction">Text direction</h2>

<p>Tamil is written horizontally, left to right.</p>

<section id="h_words">
<h3>Word boundaries</h3>
<p>Words are separated by spaces.</p>
</section>




<section id="h_quotations">
<h3 class="reviewme">Quotations</h3>
<p>The default quote marks for Tamil should be <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x201C;</span> [<span class="uname">U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</span>]</span> at the start, and <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x201D;</span> [<span class="uname">U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK</span>]</span> at the end. </p>
<p>When an additional quote is embedded within the first, the quote marks should be <span class="ex" lang="lo"><span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x2018;</span> [<span class="uname">U+2018 LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</span>]</span> and <span class="codepoint" translate="no"><span lang="th">&#x2019;</span> [<span class="uname">U+2019 RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK</span>]</span></span>. &nbsp; <span class="ednote">This is according to CLDR – need to check.</span></p>

<h2>Line &amp; paragraph layout</h2>

<section id="h_line_breaking">
<h3 class="reviewme">Line breaking</h3>
<p>The primary break opportunities for line breaking are at inter-word spaces.</p>
<p>Line breaking should not move a danda or double danda to the beginning of a new line, even if they are preceded by a space character. These punctuation characters should behave in the same way as a full stop does in English text.</p>
</section>


<section id="h_counters">
<h3 class="reviewme">Counters</h3>
<p>Counters are used to number lists, chapter headings, etc. </p>
<p>Tamil uses a numeric counter style, based on the decimal model, and using the standard Tamil digits, <span lang="ta">'௦' '௧' '௨' '௩' '௪' '௫' '௬' '௭' '௮' '௯'</span> in a decimal pattern.</p>
<div class="figwrap">

<p>Ancient Tamil also uses an additive counter style,  based on the following letters, <span lang="ta"">000 '௯௲', 8000 '௮௲', 7000 '௭௲', 6000 '௬௲', 5000 '௫௲', 4000 '௪௲', 3000 '௩௲', 2000 '௨௲', 1000 '௲', 900 '௯௱', 800 '௮௱', 700 '௭௱', 600 '௬௱', 500 '௫௱', 400 '௪௱', 300 '௩௱', 200 '௨௱', 100 '௱', 90 '௯௰', 80 '௮௰', 70 '௭௰', 60 '௬௰', 50 '௫௰', 40 '௪௰', 30 '௩௰', 20 '௨௰', 10 '௰', 9 '௯', 8 '௮', 7 '௭', 6 '௬', 5 '௫', 4 '௪', 3 '௩', 2 '௨', 1 '௧'</span>.</p>
