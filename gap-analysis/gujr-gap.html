  <section id="h_introduction">
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The W3C needs to make sure that the text layout and typographic needs of scripts and languages around the world are built in to technologies such as HTML, CSS, SVG, etc. so that Web pages and eBooks can look and behave as people expect around the world.</p>
    
    <p>This page documents issues for languages using the Gujarati script, including Gujarati, in terms of support by specifications or user agents (browsers, e-readers, etc.). </p>

    <p>A summary of this report and others can be found as part of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/gap-analysis/language-matrix.html" style="font-size: 140%;">language matrix</a>.</p>
    
    <section id="workflow">
    <h3>Work flow</h3>
    <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size: 140%;">This version of the document is a preliminary analysis</span></p>

    <p>Gap analysis work usually starts with a <strong>preliminary analysis</strong>, conducted quickly by one or a small group of experts. Then a more <strong>detailed analysis</strong> is carried out, involving a wider range of experts. The detailed analysis may involve the development of tests, in order to illustrate issues and track results for browsers. The next phase is <strong>ongoing maintenance</strong>. It is expected that the resulting document will not be frozen: as gaps are fixed, this should be noted in the document. It is also possible that new gaps are noticed or arise, and they can be added to this document when that happens.</p>
    
    <p>As the gap analysis develops, the requirements for features that are problematic will be described in the companion document, <a href="https://w3c.github.io/xxxxlreq/">Xxxx Layout Requirements</a>. Links to the appropriate part of that document should be added to this document as the material is created. Note that the requirements document should not contain any technology-specific information: all of that belongs here.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="prioritization">
    <h3>Prioritization</h3>
    <p>This document not only describes gaps, it also attempts to prioritise them in terms of the impact on the local user. The prioritization is indicated by colour.</p>
        
        <p>Key:</p>
  <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
        <li class="ok"></li>
        <li class="na"></li>
        <li class="advanced"></li>
        <li class="basic"></li>
        <li class="broken"></li>
        <li class="tbd"></li>
        </ul>
    
    <p>It is important to note that these colours do not indicate to what extent a particular features is broken. They indicate the impact of a broken or missing feature on the content author or end user.</p>
    <p>Basic styling is the level that would be generally accepted as sufficient for most Web pages. Advanced level support would include additional features one might expect to include in ebooks or other advanced typographic formats. There may be features of a script or language that are not supported on the Web, but that are not generally regarded as necessary (usually archaic or obscure features). In this case, the feature can be described here, but the status should be marked as OK.</p>
    <p>The decision as to what priority level is assigned to a described gap is down to the experts doing the gap analysis. It may not always be straightforward to decide. If a given section in this document refers to more than one feature that is broken, each with different impacts on Web users, the priority for the section should be the lowest denominator.</p>
    <p>A cell can be scored as OK if the feature in question is specified in an appropriate specification, and is supported by user agents. A specification that is in CR or later and has two implementations in 'major' browsers will count. This means that the feature may not be supported in all browsers yet. (At some point in the future we may try to distinguish, visually, whether support is available in a specification but still pending in major browsers or applications.) </p>

<section id="direction">
    <h2>Text direction</h2>
<p>See also General page layout &amp; progression for features such as column layout, page turning direction, etc. that are affected by text direction.</p>

<section id="vertical" class="basic">
<h3>Vertical text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are the script requirements for vertically oriented text met?  What about if you mix vertical text with scripts that are normally only horizontal? Do you need a switch to use different characters in vertical vs. horizontal text? Does the browser support short runs of horizontal text in vertical lines (tate-chu-yoko in Japanese) as expected? Is the orientation of characters and the directional ordering of characters supported as needed? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#vertical_text">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Avertical-text%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>



	<p>Upright characters in vertical lines of text don't break correctly, due to the problem of detecting syllable boundaries correctly mentioned above. Marking this as basic, since this is not a common use case.</p>

    <h3>Bidirectional text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">If this script runs right-to-left, are there any issues when handling that? Is bidirectional text adequately supported? What about numbers and expressions? Do the Unicode bidi controls and HTML markup provide the support needed? Is isolation of directional runs problematic? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#bidirectional_text_direction">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Abidi%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    </section>



<section id="fonts" class="ok">
    <h3>Fonts</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Do the standard fallback fonts used in browsers (eg. serif, sans-serif, cursive, etc.) match expectations? Are special font or OpenType features needed for this script that are not available?  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>Font  styles, weight, etc</h3>
    <p id="fontstylePrompt" class="status_prompt"> This covers ways of modifying the glyphs, such as for italicisation, bolding, oblique, etc. Do italic fonts lean in the right direction? Is synthesised italicisation problematic? Are there other problems relating to bolding or italicisation - perhaps relating to generalised assumptions of applicability? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#font-style">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Afont-style%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="glyphs" class="na">
    <h3>Glyph shaping and positioning</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the script in question require additional user control features to support alterations to the position or shape of glyphs, for example adjusting the distance between the base text and diacritics, or changing the glyphs used in a systematic way? Do you need to be able to compose/decompose conjuncts, or show characters that are otherwise hidden, etc? <a href="../index#glyphs_diacritics">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aglyphs-diacritics%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <h3>Cursive text</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt"> If this script is cursive (eg. Arabic, N'Ko, Syriac, etc), are there problems or needed features related to the handling of cursive text? Do cursive links break if parts of a word are marked up or styled? Do Unicode joiner and non-joiner characters behave as expected?   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#cursive">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acursive%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

<section id="transforms" class="na">
    <h3>Transforming characters</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does your script need special text transforms that are not supported? Does your script convert letters to uppercase, capitalised and lowercase alternatives according to your typographic needs? Do you need to to convert between half-width and full-width presentation forms? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#transforming_characters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-transform%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>

    <p></p>
</section>




<section id="boundaries" class="basic">
    <h3>Text segmentation &amp; selection</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">This is about how text is divided into graphemes, words, sentences, etc., and behaviour associated with that. Do Unicode grapheme clusters appropriately segment character units for your script? When you double- or triple-click on the text, is the expected range of characters highlighted? When you move through the text with the cursor, or backspace, etc. do you see the expected behaviour?  (Some of the answers to these questions may be picker up in other sections, such as line-breaking, or initial-letter styling.)   <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#graphemes">See available information</a>  or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aboundaries%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <section id="grapheme_clusters">
    <h4>Grapheme clusters</h4>
        <p>The Unicode concept of 'grapheme cluster' currently fails to represent syllabic conjuncts (plus vowels, etc) in scripts like Gujarati. This means that various editing operations, line breaking algorithms, vertical text, etc. are likely to break text at the wrong point.</p>
    <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/ilreq/#h_indic_orthographic_syllable_boundaries">Indic Layout Requirements</a> provides a grammar for indian orthographic syllable boundaries which works for Gujarati, and CSS uses the concept of <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit">'typographic character unit'</a>, rather than grapheme cluster, in its specs with the explanation that these cases are beyond the scope of the grapheme cluster concept and that implementations should provide appropriate support. In addition, a modification to the concept of grapheme cluster is <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/proposed.html#Rule_Constraints">currently in development</a> at the Unicode Consortium, which is likely to resolve the problem for a script like Gujarati.</p>
    <p>See requirements at: <a href="https://w3c.github.io/ilreq/#h_indic_orthographic_syllable_boundaries">Indic Layout Requirements</a></p>
    </section>

    <section id="danda">
    <h4>Punctuations</h4>
    <p>Gujarati uses full stop to represent the end of the sentence. However if the user wants to use the danda or double danda, as per to Unicode recommendation, they have to come from Devanagari block of Unicode. Devanagari phrase separator ।  U+0964 DEVANAGARI DANDA or ॥  U+0965 DEVANAGARI DOUBLE DANDA are encoded in the DEVANAGARI block with the intent that they should be used as common punctuation for all the major scripts of India including Gujarati.  </p>
    <p>The properties of purna viram and deergh viram should be the same as the properties of FullStop or other punctuation marks, and a new line should not begin with purna viram and deergh viram.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="spanned_conjuncts">
    <h4>Spans around partial orthographic syllables</h4>
    <p>If you put a span around the ન્ડ two characters of the 3-character syllable ન્ડિ in ઇન્ડિય (eg. in order to color or otherwise style it), the i vowel-sign no longer appears at the start of the word, but looks like it modifies the next character (ય).
	<br/>
	Apparently this requirement is a bit difficult to cater to as it requires the knowledge to be transferred by the font to the rendering engine about which part of the glyph is attributed to which code-point in storage. However, if it can be achieved, nothing like it. 
	</p>

<section id="textdecor" class="basic">
    <h3>Text decoration</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">This is about  ways of marking text (see also specific sections dedicated to quotations and inline notes/annotations). Is it possible to express emphasis or highlight content as expected? Bold, italic and under-/over-lines are not always appropriate, and some scripts have their own unique ways of doing things, that are not in the Western tradition at all. Text delimiters mark certain items or sections off from the main text, such as book names in Chinese, quotations, head markers in Tibetan, etc, and often involve the use of punctuation. Is there any behaviour that isn't well supported, such as overlines for numeric digits in Syriac?    Are there issues about the positioning or use of underlines? Some aspects related to the drawing of lines alongside or through text involve local typographic considerations. Do underlines need to be broken in special ways for this script? Do you need support for additional line shapes or widths? Does the distance or position of the lines relative to the text need to vary in ways that are not achievable? Are lines correctly drawn relative to vertical text?  <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#text_decoration">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Atext-decoration%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <section id="indiantext_textdecoration">
	<h4>Underline and Overline behavior</h4>
    <p>Indian language text has some signs called as Matras which sometimes join above the shirorekha or below the normal baseline.
	<br/><br/>
	Applications should ensure that the underline and overline when getting rendered, should adaquetly be taken into consideration. Chrome browser seemed to be perfectly rendering the underline and overline feature by breaking the same where a matra occurs. Internet Explorer also handles it a bit differently by appropriately lowering or heightening the respective lines.

<section id="quotations" class="advanced">
    <h3>Quotations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Are there any issues when dealing with quotations marks, especially when nested? Should block quotes be indented or handled specially? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#quotations">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aquotations%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


<section id="q_defaults">
<h4><a href="#q_defaults">Default quotation marks for q element</a></h4>
<p>If the <code class="kw" translate="no">html</code> tag sets the language of a page, the HTML specification says that  the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element should by default produce quotation marks according to the information in CLDR for that language.</p>
<p>For Gujarati, CLDR says that the default quote marks should be, reading right to left, “...”, and embedded quote marks ‘...’. <strong>Edge</strong> fails to produce any quotation marks, although it does so for other languages. (Firefox, Chrome &amp; Safari are ok.) See a <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#language">test and results</a>.</p>
</section>

<section id="q_section">
<h4><a href="#q_section">Default quotation marks in a new language section</a></h4>
<p>In addition, the default quotation marks for the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element  are not set to the appropriate characters by the browser  when the element appears inside a Gujarati section of a page that has a different overall language. This is currently per the HTML specification (both W3C and WhatWG).  There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636#issuecomment-384340053">an issue</a> raised against the WhatWG version for this to be changed.</p>
</section>

<section id="q_multilingual">
<h4><a href="#q_multilingual">Embedded quotations in a different language</a></h4>
<p>Gujarati quotes embedded in text in another language can also be problematic if the outer language uses different quotation marks. This is due to the browsers choosing default quotation marks based on the language of the <em>quotation</em>, rather than that of the surrounding text. See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/i18n-tests/results/the-q-element.html#ml_nesting">a test</a>. This behaviour is specified in the WhatWG version of the HTML spec, but no longer in the W3C version. There is <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/3636#issuecomment-384340053">an issue</a> raised against the WhatWG version for this to be changed.</p>
</section>

<p>Marking all the above as advanced, because use of the <code class="kw" translate="no">q</code> element is optional (quote characters can be used instead), and it can be styled using CSS for the general case.</p>

<section id="inlinenotes" class="na">
    <h3>Inline notes &amp; annotations</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">The ruby spec currently specifies an initial subset of requirements for fine-tuning the typography of phonetic and semantic annotations of East Asian text, including furigana, pinyin and zhuyin fuhao systems.

<section id="numbers" class="advanced">
    <h3>Numbers, dates, etc.</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">If  the script has its own set of number digits, are there any issues in how they are used? Does the script or language use special format patterns that are problematic (eg. 12,34,000 in India)? What about date/time formats and selection - and are non-Gregorian calendars needed?  Do percent signs and other symbols associated with number work correctly, and do numbers need special decorations, (like in Ethiopic or Syriac)? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#numbers">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Anumbers%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Both ASCII and Gujarati Numerals are used in Gujarati. Most of the user community identifies with both. However, mono-lingual (mono-script rather) readers may want a fully localized web page including numbers, date, time and calendar to name a few. </p>

    <h3>Word &amp; letter spacing</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Some scripts create emphasis or other effects by spacing out the words, letters or syllables in a word. Are there requirements for this script/language that are unsupported? (For justification related spacing, see below.) See <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#letter_spacing">available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainline-spacing%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


	<section id="syllable_spacing">
	<h4>Syllable/Akshara spacing for Indian languages</h4>
	<p>
	Gujarati is an alphasyllabary and the heart of the writing system is the Akshar. It is very common in the gujarati script to represent/brake words based on Akshara, which is instinctively recognized by users of the script. The same requirement is given <a href="https://w3c.github.io/ilreq/#h_letter_spacing">here</a>.
    <br/>
	As the W3C specification points to Unicode Text Segmentation (TR 29), it is observed that some of the browsers support it (e.g. Chrome and Firefox) whereas Microsoft Edge and Interner Explorer seems to break the words in individual characters.
	<br/>
	Also, in cases where there is wrong Akshara formation e.g. Consonant+Matra+Matra, the breaking seems to stack ill formed akshara into one set instead of clearly breaking it separate. This breaking behaviour needs to improve. 
	<br/>
	There are currently no mechanisms for syllable spacing in HTML/CSS.

<section id="counters" class="advanced">
    <h3>Counters, lists, etc.</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">The CSS Counter Styles specification describes a limited set of simple and complex styles for counters to be used in list numbering, chapter heading numbering, etc.The rules plus more counter styles (totalling around 120 for over 30 scripts) are listed in the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/predefined-counter-styles/">Ready-made Counter Styles</a>. Do these cover your needs?  Are the details correct? Are there other aspects related to counters and lists that need to be addressed? <a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#counters">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Acounter-styles%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


	<p><code class="kw" translate="no">Gujarati</code> CSS counter style is defined in the document <a href="https://w3c.github.io/predefined-counter-styles/#devanagari-styles">Ready-made Counter Styles</a>.

<section id="initialletter" class="basic">
    <h3>Styling initials</h3>
    <p class="status_prompt">Does the browser or ereader correctly handle special styling of the initial letter of a line or paragraph, such as for drop caps or similar? How about  the size relationship between the large letter and the lines alongide? where does the large letter anchor relative to the lines alongside? is it normal to include initial quote marks in the large letter? is the large letter really a syllable? etc. Are all of these things working as expected? .<a href="https://w3c.github.io/typography/index#initial_letter">See available information</a> or <a href="https://github.com/w3c/i18n-activity/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Ainitial-letter%20label%3Atype-info-request">check for currently needed data</a>.</p>


    <p>Because of the problems associated with grapheme cluster boundaries (see above), first-letter selection in CSS doesn't work well for conjuncts. For example, chrome fails to style the whole conjunct in પ્રૌદ્યોગીકી when using ::first-letter in a selector, and styles only the પ્ instead of પ્રૌ. Similar is the case of Internet Explorer, it only styles પ. This is problematic for many words in a script such as Gujarati, and forces the content author to use explicit spans rather than the proper mechanism for selecting initial letter.</p>
    <p><a href="https://w3c.github.io/ilreq/#h_indic_orthographic_syllable_boundaries">Indian Layout Requirements</a> provides a grammar for indian orthographic syllable boundaries which works for Gujarati, and CSS uses the concept of <a href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-text-3/#typographic-character-unit">'typographic character unit'</a>, rather than grapheme cluster, in its specs with the explanation that these cases are beyond the scope of the grapheme cluster concept and that implementations should provide appropriate support. In addition, a modification to the concept of grapheme cluster is <a href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr29/proposed.html#Rule_Constraints">currently in development</a> at the Unicode Consortium, which is likely to resolve the problem for a script like Gujarati.</p>
    <p>In addition, the alignment of styled initial-letter character glyphs with the rest of the text is not clearly specified or implemented.</p>

    <section id="indian_baselines">
	<h4>Indian Scripts and Baselines</h4>
	<p>By and large, Indian scripts in browsers are rendered with default fonts provided by back-end Operating Systems. If there are major differences in physical size for a particular font size, which most of the times are, it shows the mixed-script text in an un-organized way. This obviously affects all the base-line attributes.</p>
